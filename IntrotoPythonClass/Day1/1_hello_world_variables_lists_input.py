# Variables are super useful in programming.
# They are a way to store information in or program that we can use!
# To define variables in python we just need to write a name and then assign
# the variable a value. In python we donâ€™t need to worry about what type of
# thing we put in our variables like most languages, python just figures it out.
# When creating variables in python you should name them using all lowercase letters
# with underscores instead of spaces. If the number is a constant that does not change
# use all uppercase letters

# define basic variables to print
number_1 = 2
number_2 = 4
number_3 = 1.946
name = "Tristen"
GREETING = "Hello, "

#print variables
print(number_1)
print(number_2)
print(number_3)
print(name)
print(GREETING)
# print empty line
print()

# concat and input!
# concatenation is when you combing two strings.
# this can be very helpful when debugging your code
# it is very easy to combine two or more strings
print(GREETING)
print(GREETING + name)
print(GREETING + name + "!")

# print number and string
# method 1: cast number to string
print(GREETING + str(number_1))
# method 2: print list of things.  print(itemA,itemB,itemC,...)
print(GREETING, number_1)


# create lists using [] and input any number of elements to store them
# list_A = [0,1,2,3,4,5...]
list_A = [number_1, number_2, number_3]

# accessing individual items in a list using an index. The index represents
# position in the list you would like to access starting at index position 0.
# position 1
item_1 = list_A[0]
# position 2
item_2 = list_A[1]
# position 3
item_3 = list_A[2]

# printing from a list

# print whole  list
print(list_A)
# print first thing in list
print(list_A[0])
# print second thing in list
print(list_A[1])
# print third thing in list
print(list_A[2])


# print empty line
print()





# math!
# math is essential to programming. One of the cool things about programming is you can pretty much do math anywhere!
# want to print out the result of the addition of two numbers? Its easy!
