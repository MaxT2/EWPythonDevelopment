# math is really important in program as computers think using numbers
# when we check if something equals something else the computer compares the number
# representation of the variable or object to see if they are identical
# When programming you can perform math operations pretty much anywhere

# Challenge: print the output of adding two number together
print(2 + 4)

# run your program ( Why is it not running correctly!)
# anytime we work on new python files we need to make sure we are running this file
# and not the one we previously ran. You can see in the top right that we still have the
# 1_hello_world_variables_lists_input.py selected to run
# right click in your .py coding window and select run

# Challenge: Print the output of one number subtracted by another number!
print(2-4)

# Challenge: Multiplication * ? Division / ?
print(2*4)
print(2/4)


# meaningful print statement
# lets make a print statement message to go along with our output
# Practice: Does this work? If not what error do we get?
print("2+4 = " + 2+4)
# type mismatch error and we need an extra set of parethesis around 2+4
print("2+4 = " + (2+4))
# still doesnt work, lets cast the number result of 2+4 to a string
print("2+4 = " + str(2+4))

# Challenge: create two variables and output the addition of the two numbers
num_1 = 2
num_2 = 4
print(num_1 + num_2)

# Challenge: add a message to your output
print(num_1, "+", num_2, "=", (num_1 + num_2))
