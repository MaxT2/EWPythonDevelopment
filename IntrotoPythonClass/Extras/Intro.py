Make an error

“Hello” Print hello world, Name and save - Print, naming, saving program

Modify to print “Hello “ + name - Input, variable
Modify to ask for name - Input
Modify to ask for first name and last name

Add numbers

Define two variables var1=8 and var2=4 and print results,  Save. - Variables
Modify program to add, multiply, divide, subtract - Operators
Change program to ask for number (woops, 84) - Type conversion int()
Counting loop - for x in range
Count from 1 to 10 using for loop


Guessing game - Import random, while loop


Pygame intro notes
Day 4/5-8

Day 1:
Create new directory in project and name it pygame_setup
Teach basic project setup. What is the minimal amount of code we need to make a python game. Why is each line important?
Save the project setup file as a template and then Save As a new project to introduce the coordinate system and basic drawing
coordinate system, X and Y axis, Where is the origin 0,0?
Show how to fill the screen with one color
Show the students how to draw each shape
Basic colors: RGB and how to store them in variables and use them when drawing shapes
Show RGB Color Picker in pycharm. Random Color?
Challenge: Draw a house using some of the basic shapes. Help them with the initial triangle which can confuse students Give them some time to work it out and then slowly do it along with them for those who are having troubles. Color your house and background, add a moon or sun?
Show them how to make a moving sun across the screen? I don't know if its easy to do. If so ill show them otherwise I will leave it out
I think that is enough for Day 1

Day 2: Drawing Program / Bouncing ball? I think I can only do one and will probably do some sort of drawing program. Depending on how interested they are we can go really deep into the drawing program or basic functionality and move on to something else

Day 3/4: Making a game! I have done games like Pong in the past but it takes a bit of code to create and doing more than one collision mechanism usually confused the kids more than it should. Instead of Pong I have moved onto making games where the player is some sort of object at the bottom of the screen and things are falling randomly from the top. The object is to either catch or avoid of the objects.

I will send you the code I come up with for day 1 when it is done.
